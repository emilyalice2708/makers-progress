# Week 8

## Goals:
- Use Rails to test-drive the creation of 'Acebook'.
- Apply the following features in ActiveRecord:
  - Validations
  - Associations
  - Scopes
- Understand the relationship between resources and REST.
- Understand nested routing and how to restrict resources routes using 'except' and 'only'.
- Understand how to respond to requests for different formats (e.g. HTML/JSON) on the same route.
- Differentiate between business logic and presentation logic and understand where in Rails this code should be.
- Test a rails app with Capybara, RSpec and Cucumber.

## Plans:
- Remain focused on the project criteria and continue to use TDD.
- Focus on learning rather than completion of the project.
