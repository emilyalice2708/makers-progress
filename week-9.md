# Week 9

## Goals:
- Convert our Acebook on rails into an API.
- Create a React frontend.

## Plans:
- Focus on learning, mob on react to begin with to ensure the whole team can learn.

## Acebook Progress
### Monday:
- Goals: Gain a basic understanding of react and set up a new frontend.
- Reflections: 
  - Youtube videos can be an amazing learning resource, but we were also careful to always check documentation.
  - We mobbed today, which has slowed us down a little but has also ensured that everyone has gained a good understanding React.

### Tuesday:
- Goals: 
  - Refactor the backend to render JSON, remove views files, amend tests to maintain test-coverage(KC and Charlie).
  - Implement sign-up and login on React frontend using Axios (Gonzalo and myself).
- Reflections:
  - Mocking an API using Jest is still a bit confusing, adding to tomorrow's to-dos.

### Wednesday:
- Goals: 
  - Mock the API and axios to successfully test registration API call (Charlie and myself).
  - Refactor rendering of comments and amend tests in the Rails backend (KC and Gonzalo).

### Thursday:
- Goals:
  - Replace sessions with Jason Web Tokens while maintaining test coverage.
  - Add authentication token functionality to React frontend and requests posts (Gonzalo and Charlie).
  - Work together as a group to ensure frontend and backend work together.
  - Use bootstrap to add styling.
  - Retrieve comments and likes.
 Reflections:
  - Maintaining test-coverage on the backend was time-consuming but important, we prioritised our test-coverage over project progress. 
  - Staying up until 3am is tiring but sometimes worth it.
  - We didn't manage to implement the functionality that would allow a user to like or comment on a post, but test-coverage on the frontend was already lagging, and pushing ahead to spike this would have likely results in lowering the code quality given our time constraints.

### Friday:
- Goals: 
  - Create a presentation and present our project during the demo.
  - Use the afternoon to learn Cypress and begin feature testing the frontend.
- Reflections:
  - Cypress seems like a fantastic tool that we wished we'd discovered earlier in the week.
  - Next time I would prefer to focus more heavily on testing with the front-end. Given the short time period between the surprise addition to the criteria and our intro to React, we prioritised completing a functioning front end above maintaing test-coverage.
