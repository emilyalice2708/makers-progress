# Week 2


## Goals:
- Practice skills from week 1. ✔️
- Be able to break one class into two, without compromising test coverage. ✔️
- Understand how to unit test classes in isolation with mocking. ✔️
- Explain basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns. ✔️
- Review another person's code and give meaningful feedback.✔️

## Plans:
- Complete practical from week 2 (Testing OO relationships using Mocking). 
- Complete practical from week 2 (Dependency Injection).
- Work on Mocking Skills workshop.
- Take part in Code Review workshop. 
- Research 4 main OO principles: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance.

## Evidence:
- Oyster challenge - [repo](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/oystercard-challenge)
- Take Away challenge - [repo](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/takeaway-challenge)
- Completed practicals and coach validation (zoom call).
- Practical repos: 
  - [Testing OO relationships using Mocking](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/testing_relationships_between_classes)
  - [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/dependency_injection_practical)
  
## Daily Goals:
### Monday:
- Goal: Gain a better understanding of use of doubles with rspec.
- Plan: Complete week 2 practical, Testing OO relationships using Mocking.
- Evidence: Zoom call with coach to talk through the practical and my solution.

### Tuesday:
- Goal: Become a better planner and get some more practice using rspec.
- Plan: Watch coach video on planning, attend diagramming workshop, begin work on Dependency Injection practical.
- Evidence: Record the process of coding a challenge from the process workshop and ask for feedback from coach.

### Wednesday:
- Goal: Gain a better understanding of OO principles.
- Plan: Work on the OO Relationships (Forwarding, Polymorphism) practical.
- Evidence: Get some feedback from a coach.

### Thursday:
- Goal: Cement what I've learnt so far about TDD and OO principles and gain a basic understanding of delegation.
- Plan: Revisit practicals and process workshop challenge and use coach feedback to guide my focus, take part in the delegation skills workshop.
- Evidence: Have a conversation with a coach to verify that I am on the right track, compare delegation work with the solutions.

### Friday:
- Goal: Practice extracting one class into two without compromising test coverage, improve understanding of mocking and dependency injection.
- Plan: Work through Oyster challenge, complete final exercises on Dependency Injection practical, begin working through Mocking skills workshop.
- Evidence: Chat with cohort and compare our work to decipher whether we could improve our own and whether we have compromised testing during extraction.
