- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges). ✔️
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives. ✔️
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow. ✔️
- Give and receive meaningful code review. ✔️

## Plans:

- Bowling challenge - [repo (solution 1)](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/bowling-challenge-ruby)
- Bowling challenge - [repo (solution 2)](https://github.com/emilyalice2708/simpler-bowling)

## Daily Goals:
### Monday:
- Goal: Create a plan and learn the basics of github collaboration.
- Plan: Decide on an MVP and translate each relevant headline specificaiton into a user story. Use balsamiq to create a model for the web app and then learn how to use a branch/PR/merge git flow.
- Evidence: Discussion with coach at end of the day about our plans and validate our understanding of github.

### Tuesday:
- Goal: Mob on the first specification.
- Plan: Work with entire team to set us a basic structure for our project.
- Evidence: Peer validation.

### Wednesday:
- Goal: Pair on user story to allow users to post spaces on the webpage.
- Plan: Use databases and last week's Bookmark challenge notes to set up a database connection and create the 'add space' featrue, following RESTful routes guidelines.
- Evidence: Coach validation.

### Thursday:
- Goal: Give meaningful code review. Pair on user story to allow users to log in and out securely.
- Plan: Code review the work of other team members in the morning before merging their branches to main. Use RESTful routes and the Ruby gem 'BCrypt' to offer a secure sign-in/sign-out process.
- Evidence: Coach validation.

### Friday:
- Goal: Create a presentation and prepare a demo of our app.
- Plan: Pair up to tie up loose ends on the project (implement basic payment functionality using the Ruby gem 'Stripe' and use CSS to improve the aesthetic of the web page), rehearse presentation and answer reflection questions.
- Evidence: Demonstrated the project to the cohort and received good feedback.
